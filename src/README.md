# Notes

This assignment took longer than expected because it has been a while since I have used TypeScript. I spent roughly 4 hours on the assignment in total, but I did cut a fair few corners along the way to get it done in time.

The order processing, invoices, and restocking reports work, but I left TODOs for things I didn't get to. These mostly consist of tests, a few bugs, and refactoring
